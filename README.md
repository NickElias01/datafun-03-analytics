# Data Processing and Fetching Module

## Overview

This Python module demonstrates various data processing and fetching techniques, showcasing skills in handling text, CSV, Excel, and JSON data. It is designed for educational purposes, emphasizing the use of Python's standard and external libraries to fetch, process, and store data in different formats.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves data from web sources using the `requests` library, supporting text, CSV, Excel, and JSON formats.
- **Data Processing**: Includes functions to process the fetched data, such as counting words in text files, summarizing CSV data, analyzing Excel sheets, and summarizing JSON objects.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the processed data in appropriate formats, such as text files, CSV, Excel, and JSON, using built-in Python libraries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment with the following libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-processing-module.git
   cd data-processing-module

## Create and activate a virtual environment:

## Usage

This module is designed to be run as a script or imported into other Python programs. Below is an example of how to use the main functionalities:

### 1. Fetching Data

Fetch data from a specified URL and save it to a local file.

python
from your_module import fetch_and_write_txt_data, fetch_and_write_csv_data, fetch_and_write_excel_data, fetch_and_write_json_data

fetch_and_write_txt_data('data/txt', 'example.txt', 'https://example.com/textfile.txt')
fetch_and_write_csv_data('data/csv', 'example.csv', 'https://example.com/data.csv')
fetch_and_write_excel_data('data/excel', 'example.xls', 'https://example.com/data.xls')
fetch_and_write_json_data('data/json', 'example.json', 'https://example.com/data.json')

### 2. Processing Data

After fetching the data, the next step is processing it. The module provides functions to read and analyze the data, with results being written to summary files.

#### Processing Text Data

python
from your_module import process_text_data

# Process the text data and generate a summary file
process_text_data('data/txt', 'example.txt', 'results_txt.txt')

### 3. Writing Data

The module also includes functions to write processed data to different file formats. This ensures that your data is saved in the desired format for further analysis or sharing.

#### Writing Text Files

python
from your_module import write_txt_file

# Write text data to a file
data = "This is an example text."
write_txt_file('data/txt', 'example_output.txt', data)


### 4. Processing Data

The module also includes functions to process the fetched data. Processing can include tasks such as counting words, summarizing CSV data, analyzing Excel files, and extracting key information from JSON files.

#### Processing Text Data

python
from your_module import process_text_data

# Process text data: count words and unique words
process_text_data('data/txt', 'data.txt', 'results_txt.txt')
